# Telecom Industry Customer Churn Prediction

We use a customer churn dataset from the telecom industry which includes customer data, usage of long-distance, data usage, monthly revenue, type of offerings, and other services purchased by customers. The data, based on a fictional telecom firm, include several Excel files which have been combined and are avilable in the data folder. 

We would proceed with classification as the approach to predict whether a customer would churn or not !
